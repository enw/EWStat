# EWStat - Javascript Statistics Library

## Synopsis
Collect samples of a population. Get descriptive statics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation. We'll add regression linear regression to measure the relationship between different fields.

## Code Example
```
 ///
 /// TODO
 ///

 // add samples

 // get descriptive statistics

 // do linear regression
```

## Motivation
When I discovered [AbeBooks](http://www.abebooks.com/) I went a bit overboard buying awesome old textbooks.  One of them was Freedman et al.'s [Statistics (Second Edition)](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=10725311326&searchurl=kn%3Dfreedman%2Bstatistics%2Bsecond%2Bedition%26amp%3Bsts%3Dt%26amp%3Bx%3D0%26amp%3By%3D0). I started this when reading up on Statistics 'for fun'.
